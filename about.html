        <p> I was born and raised in Wuhan, a city in the middle of China. I first came to the United States in 2011, and have been studying here since then. During the past eight years, I have spent my time in Alabama, Minnesota, and California. I'm currently a graduating senior at UC Berkeley studying physics and astronomy.</p>
